# sort-game
A game based on sorting columns and rows of matrices

The idea of the game is to start with a matrix where all the numbers are out of order.
The player has the option to sort any row or column in ascending or descending order, and by doing so, the other columns or rows will follow.
The goal is to get all the numbers in the matrix in ascending order. 
I invented the game myself, and decided to program it to see if it actually works.
For all I know, it might be super easy, or maybe it's impossible.
Who knows.
